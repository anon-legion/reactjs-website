this is booking website, user can book, select dates, etc.

? create state for date in order to have today's date selected by default;
if it's not possible to select multiple dates, here's a possible workaround for it: check-in is date 1, and check-out is date 2. Next, catch those 2 dates in function and add dates between 1 and 2 and then return text "you're booking for x number of days"

[] - all nav links are bright color, when hovered onto one, only that one is bright, others are dark colors
